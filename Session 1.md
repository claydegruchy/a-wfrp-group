# Story
You all awaken in an Inn, hungover as all hell. You have no memory of the preceeding day. You go down stairs, take food from the kind but stern Esme (who seems to be the halfling tavern keep of the Pointed Anchor) and, after a rocky attempt at plicating an annoyed ogre, begin to recollect the previous days events.

You're in the town of Carroburg, you arrived yesterday. You all met during the afternoon, when a fight broke out in an allyway between two men (possibily a robbery), though you dont remember what they were fighting over. You all fought a fistfight with them. 

- Mandred was given a shinging eye by one assailant, and a sore arm by another.
- One man was stabbed in the back by Karl
- Another completely demolished by Meiks practiced fistfighting ability. 
- The "leader" escaped into an alley. 

The person being robbed was extremely thankful and gave you 5 silver each for helping them, telling you to have a good night with it.

You all go to a bar and get to know each other. 

You made the most of the money given as well, heading to a variety of drinking places in town and chatting to various folks while pissed. Seems a lot was happening in town, from trader disputes, to gang crimes, and nobel family differences. To name but a few of your escapades, you meet:
- A swaying drunk with very little to say and a wide jaw
- Meik befriends a pair of old sailors, who treat you to repeditive gossip
- A pair of "card sharps" are blunted by Karl's gambling ability
- Mandred is offered a job by the blackpikes

You also try to visit some very closed seedy bars and are denied and end up going to a rich mans bar (with a little of Karls way with words explaining away your shabby atire to the armed bouncers outside, with a little help from Meik). Once inside, young man puts you in touch with one Jarome von Valtbliz, who has some family trouble that he'd like disposible assistance with, and writes you a note of when and where to meet. Karl attempts to get some information out of some nearby folks (very successfully) and makes a friend or two without event cheating anyone, while Meik and Mandred get to know each other. Helpfully, the young man who introduced you also covers your drinks for the evening, preventing you from finding out if the bouncers outside know how to use their swords.

Your memory then gets extremely hazy, and your exact actions are difficult to say.

The next day, after dealing with a hangover and a "cheated" Ogre, you head out into the town. On the way, Karl enters the The Drowned Rat in Docksward, dispite not having been invited and having stabbed one of the Pikes only the day before. Runs out being chased by several angry, tattooed thugs. Loses favorite deck of cards, but luckily not an arm.

Eventually you make your way to Jaromes house to find a very unpleasent man (with a taste for young house maids), though perhaps he just likes people to arrive on time to their appointments (you are at least an hour late). Arrogant and agressive and caked with makeup, he tells the aprty that he is jealious of his brother's (Lord Oscar) success, and wishes for his place at the right hand of Wulfram von Todbringer. Hes not interested in details, and just wants it done.

Calling on Karl's connection from the past, you meets up with Ecchart Fuchs (borther of Karls household maid, Emilia Fuchs). He tells you some interesting info of the von Valtbliz family, including the location of the von Valtbliz Manor.

After getting to the von Valtbliz Manor, you arrive and are obviously thought to be workers or people needing jobs, and are dismissed from the front door quicky to the servents entrance. Seems you must attempt to enter the household. With some good speaking and better rolls (Meiks knowledge of fish being of great use, and buying time for Karls charm to kick in), you manage to score jobs in the von Valtbliz Manor in Darkfair. 

The head of the house (the Butler) is a harried man, who says the extra assistance for the maids and cooks would be useful. Lord Oscar seems like an OK boss too, you meet him in his sitting room after dressing up ( and though Mandred "accidentally" shaved off his eyebrows, Lord Oscar didn't seem to mind) he approves your hiring. Karl and Mandred quickly prove their worth by materialsing 3 oaktrees worth of wood out of the thin air located around the neighbors wood pile, and Meik manages to win the cook over by showing a great keenness for fish and its acquisition. Most of the household enjoys the company of you all, dispite the missing hair above the eye on some. 

It the comes out that Lord Oscar has a strange habit of running around town dressed as a peasent, as you don't need disguises to look poor, Meik lends his shoes to the lord to assist in his disguise (and bags some new shoes in the proccess). You manage find and follow the tracks of Meiks old shoes in the snow to a some sort of drinking complex (The Three Pubs.) in town, 3 differnt "fun" houses and split up to search. 
1. A heavy drinking place - Everyone goes into this bar, but it quickly shows to be empty of the lord.
2. A brothel - Taken by Mandred, finds nothing but large tits and a decent deal on weirdroot.
3. An opium den - Both Karl and Meik take this and while enjoying the fumes, find the square jaw of Lord Oscar von Valtbliz, dressed some basic peasent garb. 

While shocked to see them, Lord Oscar von Valtbliz seems to think his disguise is working and take the opertunity to ask about himself of you. Eventually Mandred joins outside and everyone heads off to a night of heavy drinking in various bars. It seems that Lord Oscar von Valtbliz is actually a pretty nice guy and you feel that maybe shaming him so his psychotic brother can control the city might be a bad idea.

Its decided that Lord Oscar von Valtbliz needs to know of the issue, but believing him to be a soft touch, Karl attempt to convince the Butler to take a letter to theGraf (Wulfram von Todbringer). It seems the graf might not be the most understanding chracter, but instead you decide you may simply be able to convince Lord Oscar.

Though the world was against it, fate was on the side of you (5 fate total infact) and the Lord Oscar is convined, a strong case made by Karl's undeniable charm, assisted by Meik and Mandreds helpful notes. Handing over his diamond gold hammer of sigmar necklace as proof, Lord Oscar sends you to see Jarome. 

Jarome was not ready for this appointment but his newly hired housemaid lets you in to his darkened room. Jarome is in a terrible state, ranting and raving, and writing without ink. Its clear that his is a man deranged, and you feel better than ever about not giving keys of the city. Given his state, you insist on payment immidately, and he awards you 2 gold each. You tell him that his brother needs to be outed in public and that he should meet them at Pub 2 of the The Three Pubs tomorrow.

While making your way back to the Manor, the village is rocked by a massive explosion. Seems a ship in the river has been attacked, but by who or what is a mystery. People run to the dock to help, you continue to the manor as you have improtant news for Lord Oscar.

The next evening, on arrival, Lord Oscar is shocked at his brothers appearance, having not seen him for 2 years dispite living in the same city. He asks the party to get the ball rolling. Jarome erupts, throwing a table over the room, implaing one of Lord Oscars guards. It seems his state of mind is as twisted as his body, with scales and claws under his makeup. 

With a miraculous deflection, Karl manages to avoid being skewered by the 12cm long claw and Meiks stabs bounce off the Jarome-things scaled skin, Mandred puts his solid skills as a rough and tumble coachman to use, with a powerful handgun shot though the beasts twin shoulder, followed by a dagger though the eye and into the brain of the noble-turned-creature. Meik makes sure the beast is dead with a cut from shoulder to liver. 

Lord Oscar is struck by the proceedings, and in a state of shock. He rewards you with a 1 gold bond to the Nuln Armory, a business concern he is involved with in Nuln. Karl smartly convinces the socked nobel that he already handed over the necklace to the Jarome, which he sadly accepts. In time, Jaromes lodging in the Docksward will be searched, hopefully it will be found there. 

It also seems that the gangs were responsabile for the ship explosion, and that the detonated ship won't have anything to do with the Hooks (the ship is merely called The Hook), and is carrying linen for bandages and other medical supplies for the fight in Hochland against the beastmen. This does not bode well for the Blackpikes.

You shoot around thoughts about what you'll do now. Mandred has a cart that needs returning, perhaps you could all go together?

		ie, what are things that i could be doing that could be good for my char or make sense, but that dont take the limeloight.
		more guidance on what CAN be done while not taking part in the main story.
	it would be good to know what sorts of things are factored into combat or scinarios.
	make everyone use their specalties more often, perhaps more background chars?
1. What sort of situations would you like to do more of in future sessions?
	sealth was good but make it harder, make the stakes higher but more difficult to get. ie, what if we had to get rid fo the staff of a house to get into it.
1. What themes did you enjoy from this session? 
	more witch huntery, more staff of the cities, ie the officals and guards. 
	more 'picking a side', where there are consequences and befits, ie helping the guards may make them easier on you.
	the 'anyone is under suspicon' is intersted. witch hunters are assholes, but can be good friends. 
	more warhammery? warhammer has a lot of itneresting things, more flavour is nice.
