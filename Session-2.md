# Story
## Part 1
# Location: Guthugel
The carriage rattles over yet another bump in the dirt road, sending a jolt of pain through your already aching back. You could swear you’ve been on the road for years, though in reality, it’s been closer to a month. The roads, forests, and towns you’ve passed through, ferrying passengers on their journeys, have all started to blur together and you’re beginning to consider packing it all in and setting up house in whatever the next town is.

“Roads were better in my day.” Mutters a voice from one of the carriage seats. “Not so many of ‘em, of course. This ‘ere was all fields.” Looking around you, you’d argue this ‘ere was still all fields.

The voice, which has been an endless feature for the past few hours, belongs to Cooper Fitzpatrick, a retired lumberjack who, along with his pet pig, has hired you to transport him to Mittelweg. Glancing up at the sun, you try to calculate how many more hours you’ll need to listen to him and the odds of you dumping him in a ditch on the way.

Just as you’re fantasizing about booting the old man out of the moving carriage, salvation appears. Ahead on the road is Guthugel, a small but moderately prosperous town. Though the town itself is home to only around 900 people, it more than triples in size several times a year thanks to its highly popular seasonal markets.

The horses are in need of food and rest, and you and your friends in dire need of some recreation. Given that you’ve made good progress and are only a short distance from your final destination, you decide to spend a couple of hours enjoying the market. You part ways with your passenger and his porcine pal, agreeing to meet back at the cart later.

After days of sleepy villages and mostly empty roads, the market is a breath of fresh air. The atmosphere is alive with excitement and the air rich with the shouts of salespeople and traders of all kinds. Tents stretch off in every direction and you quickly find yourself drawn into the throng of the crowd and to the many and varied wares on display.

Most of the goods are well outside your meagre savings but, with a little haggling and lot of browsing, you eventually come away with some new gear. Among other things, Karl picks up a second dagger, Meik a waterproof cloak and a slingshot, and Mandred kits himself out with some armour and a spear.

Just as you’re thinking of heading off, you’re drawn to a spectacle: an alchemist hawking his amazing and powerful strength potions. Karl immediately pegs him as a charlatan but the naive Meik can’t help himself and soon finds himself on stage giving a demonstration. After taking a sip of the potion, he is miraculously able to lift the showman’s cart. With the potion’s merits proven, the crowd rush to buy, and the party pick up a few for themselves.

The market starts to wind down and you and your companions are back on the road. The evening draws in and your destination draws near. The birdsong and the rocking of the cart lulls you into daydreams of warm beds and full stomachs.

# Location: 1 mile south of Mittelweg
You are startled from your reverie by a piercing scream from off in the woods. As the carriage comes to a stop, several more screams tear through the night. Fearing that someone is in danger, you leave the old man and the pig to guard the carriage while you head off to investigate.

The darkness in the forest is far deeper than it was on the road and you cautiously pick your way towards the sounds. After a few tense minutes, you come upon a clearing where a horrifying scene is taking place. A young couple and their infant child lie on the ground being viciously attacked by 3 beastmen. Seeing that at least one of them appears to still be alive, the party goes to their aid.

The beastmen—a large goat-headed Gor and two smaller unGors—seem surprised by your presence, rounding on you as you attack.
Mandred blasts at the Gor with his pistol, seriously injuring it. He himself is hit by a poorly thrown spear, vindicating his armour purchase Guthugel. Before Mandred can recover, Karl charges into the fray.
On the other side of the melee, Meik finds himself in a wrestling match with a spear-wielding unGor, grappling it to the ground. After trading blows and cuts, he wraps an arm around its neck and holds on for dear life, choking it.
In a frenzy, the Gor swings its mighty axe at Karl. Seeing that the end is almost upon him, Karl musters up all his strength and courage, kicking the Gor’s legs from under it. In the confusion, they both tumble to the ground.
Despite its wounds, the Gor strikes a massive blow to Karl’s head, before being finished off by a well-aimed stab from Mandred. Seeing their ally defeated, the unGors flee into the trees.

The party reviews the carnage before them. The man and child are torn to pieces and, by now, the woman has also died. Investigating more closely, Mandred prizes a delicate comb from the Gor’s fist which you decide to take with you. Finally, Mandred cuts off the Gor’s head and Karl (with a little help) takes its axe as proof of your encounter. Wounded and exhausted, you make your way back to the carriage where you discover your brave guard, and his pig, comfortably asleep.

# Location: Mittelweg
After a short and nervous drive, you arrive in Mittelweg. The hour is late and the village is mostly asleep. As you part ways with Cooper, he advises that you’ll find places to sleep in the church or the inn. Needing somewhere to stable the horses, you start with the inn but find the staff there surly and unhelpful and the fees for the night exorbitant. They suggest that if you don’t like what they’re offering you might want to check out the house of Vixea, the local whore.

You try the church but find no one home and so, irritated and out of options, you return to the inn. Mandred and Meik settle for a cold wash, a meagre meal, and the one available bed while Karl chooses to visit Vixea. There he finds a warm bath and warm food and while he also has to share a bed, he doesn’t mind as much.
