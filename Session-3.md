# Story
## Part 1
# Location: 3 miles south of Middenheim
Heaving and straining, the broken cart is eventually moved from the road at the insentience of whatever military man is watching you all from horseback. You've seen several groups of solidiers coming south, and its helpfully broken up the trip. Thammid has taken to reading "revered" Dwarven stories, which inevitably involve the winning of gold, grudges or both.

Vixia has been asking Karl many questions on how to be such a good liar and Karl has been a great teacher, with Thammid almost beliving that Vixia actually enjoys his stories. 


## Part 2
Coming soon
