# Story
## Part 1
# Location: 3 miles south of Middenheim
Heaving and straining, the broken cart is eventually moved from the road at the insentience of whatever military man is watching you all from horseback. You've seen several groups of solidiers coming south, and its helpfully broken up the trip. Thammid has taken to reading "revered" Dwarven stories, which inevitably involve the winning of gold, grudges or both.

Vixia has been asking Karl many questions on how to be such a good liar and Karl has been a great teacher, with Thammid almost beliving that Vixia actually enjoys his stories.


## Part 2
# Location: Middenheim


you awaken to muttering in your shared room, a breeze bringing smell of the street wafting in though the window, the same breeze that kept you on the edge of cold most of the night. while there is a obvious unpleasentness to it, mostly animal dung and sweat, you can also smell food cooking, dust, woodsmoke from burners, the moister in the air and feel the buzz of the city waking.

"one of yous has been going though my things!" the sound of yelling startles your eyes open. a townsman in your small, shared room is shouting at no one in particular. "me coin is gone and theres scratches on me locks. who was it?!" he issues a challange to the others in the room, who have been rousing a little longer than you all, with a few up and dressed for the day already, despite the rain.

"it wasn't me!" cries a mousey scholar in his shrill voice. "well it was fuckin one of yas, disgusting! theives!". you're all still tight under the blankets, listening to the chaos unfold.


he demands everyone open their bags and is met by a hearty fuck off.
tired, the party get out of bed to find they have things missing also. theres a suggestion that they all got to he guards.

everyone shuffles downstairs, oats for breakfast. seems thammid is already awake, he waves the party over.

everyone disccusses their plan for the day, thammid is annoyed that no one actually seems to be in operating condition as he asked, except for skarl. everyone heads to thammids room to get some privacy before discussing the heist. its agreed that a plan should be made, so everyone agrees on the tasks of the days.

the group (less thammid) goes to see meiks baker friend to ask where another lad from their village is these days. the anchor is apparently in ostwald, everyone sets off thought the narrow streets to this less reputable part of town.

the anchor is found in the drowned rat, and after some hellos, they heads to his house to see his wife bertha with the hopes that she can tailor some clothes. 2s later, and shes working at it. you also get the downlow on the low kings and a possible intro to The Man.

after this, you then head towards altmarkt, and while you run into some issues with guards on the way due to karls shitty clothes, you eventually make it to the brettonian house inn.

meik begins hunting around for the dwarf, 'half nose', while mandred gets drinks. the innkeeper, seeing an easy mark, asks for a full shilling for only 3 beers. mandred wont take it and is accused of theft by the innkeeper, who produces a blunderbuss after some argument. attempting to descalate the situatuon, karl forces  the innkeeper into a deep conversation about guns and blunderbusses, talking the innkeepers ear off. as he does so, mandred takes the blunderbuss from the innkeeper, which raises the alarm.

the innkeeper begins ringing a bell and people start piling out of the pub. the large, muscled man who is recognised to work for the lowest king arrives, and seems to quickly sight mandred, in his up town clothes, as a troublemaker of some sort and starts swinging without asking any further questions.

in the meantime, meik finds 'half nose', who seemed to be "entertaining" someone alreay, asking for the party to return in 15 mins. karl standsby and watches as the situation spirals out of control.

a fistfight ensues with mandred getting a hard hit to the stomach and returning fire for an outstanding hit to the thugs right eye, blinding him. in his anger, the thug draws a dagger and swings wildly, only to be outfoxed by mandreds quick reactions and tripped on his ass.

meik rips the ringing bell off the wall to silencec the racket, then grabs the other two and quickly hightails it out of there, leaving the thug sprawled angrily on the ground. the group take some back allys and disappear into the crowd.

you all head to the cut purse tavern to lay low while meik does a bit of work. shortly after, the boss shows up. hes been visited by the stevedoors guild and has a blackeye to shhow for it. he says that meik has to go elseware for work and kicks the lot of you out of the pub.

mandred and meik head back to the split veil to make sure mandred isnt bleeding out or something. karl heads to the lowest king.

the lowest king is drunk when karl arrives and hes seen in by the thug they saw earlier. apparently the thug was the lowest kings godson, with the lowest king being fairly annoyed abotu the fight but not particularly suprised. he generally rambles on and is unhelful.

with mandred cchecked by thammmid for interal damage,the pair decide to call it a night, but not before meik spends some time talking to the angry man from their shared room. meik wants membership to the stevedoors guild or to work for them in some capacity, he suggests that meik try the cable lifts instead, as knots are easy for sailors. a while later, karl returns home and a plan is hatched. the group will get a cake and letter for annabel, this will let you scope out the building and maybe even poke around inside, as well as assess the negiborhood. you retire for a big day tomorrow.

an early morning the next day, you meet in the commonroom and get your shhit together. meik heads off to get the cake, mandred goes to the guild to find some delviery jobs and karl goes to get the new clothes.

mandred makes it to the coach house, uses his key to get in and wakes up alister. though tired, alister helps mandred read the job listings and he picks out two that will take him to the `nobs quater`. he also grabs an attracctive jacket, used specifically for delivering to rich clients, as it keeps the guards at bay. hes also asked to think about what he wants to specialise in, cant be a jack of all forever.

karl makes it to the anchors place, thought he reception in breif, he gets his new pants and shirt, then heads to vixeas boyfriends place. gabreal turns out to be a nice, older and somewhat rambling butler of a new nob household in the `trade disctrct`, he is happy to help concoct a love letter to karls "new fancy" and also shares that annabel is currently seeing someone, some nob who might be a bit of a druggo. vixea is somewhat chilly and seems to want karl out of there as quick as possiblle, but thanks to a convincing cock and bull story about a robery, karl manages to get a decent, albeit old, pair of shoes.

meik finds his friend isnt working but is able to get a very fancy brettonian "cuppe cake", on walk to the lift company he spies a familiar face: wanted posters.

after a debrief with thammid, it seems that a bounty has been put most of your heads (karls twice). this might make the heist a little harder.
